# PhotoReorder
## Overview
First of all, this is a *playground*! Every code, each commit in this repository is a result of a game. A game, which is named: DEVELOPMENT!
 
Secondly. Here are some code what started it's life as a C# project with SVN source control. I used it at home, on my own developer environment. All comments are on native hungarian (sorry).

## The project
There are two applications at this project. Both application are working with photo folders.
* a photo reorganizer
* a folder comparer

### PhotoReorder
Try to explain a general user with a general digital camera with a big enough memory card. The user is made lots of photos on an event. Few days later there is an other event and an other amount of photos, and so on...

On one day the user copy all pictures from the card to the PC. Several new events, a new amount of photos and a new copy of some images. The user is general, so he or she hasn't any professional process to archive images...

During the copying of images, two questions can be came alive:
* which image is copied
* where i saved the image earlier
